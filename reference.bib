The evolving nature of this technology and its application in finance means that the full extent of its strengths and weaknesses is yet to be fully understood.

A comprehensive literature review positions the study and informs the solution framework proposed. The solution framework sets out the key considerations of an organisation in terms of setting strategic priorities around the explainability of AI systems, the institution of appropriate model governance structures, the technical considerations in XAI analytics, and the imperative to evaluate explanations. The use case demonstration brings the XAI discussion to life through an application to AI based credit risk management, with focus on credit default prediction.},
